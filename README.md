# Syntharion
Syntharion is an AI system detecting faint, fast asteroids missed by traditional methods. Using EfficientNet-B1 trained on 1M+ synthetic images, it achieved 99.8% accuracy with 0.02% false positives and 70% faster processing. It detected four new asteroids and supports planetary defense without supercomputers.
